### Can I Print this for my Class, Home, Friends?
Yes! You are permitted to print and distribute PDF versions of these pages for use in catechesis.

### Do I have to give you credit?
It sure would be nice. Artists always like to know their art is being recognized as useful and beautiful. Please retain the attribution at the bottom of the PDF pages. And honestly, who wouldn't like to see that an actual priest drew this stuff? Cool, right? Maybe your most troubled PSR student will be inspired to consider a vocation to religious life.

### Does this cost anything?
No. These are provided free of charge. If you'd like to make a donation for thier use, please consider supporting [The Catholic Underground](https://catholicunderground.com), Fr. Decker's media apostolate.
