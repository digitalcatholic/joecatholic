Joe Catholic started as a catechetical comic in the vein of the Sunday comic [ShortCuts](https://www.gocomics.com/shortcuts "ShortCuts on Go Comics") by Jeff Harris. Diving into the adventure that is The Catholic Faith, Joe and his friends find themselves right in the middle of fun aspects of Catholic life. Subjects include Church history, sacramental theology, moral life, and liturgy.
