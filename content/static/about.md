Joe Catholic started as a catechetical comic in the vein of
the Sunday comic [ShortCuts](https://www.gocomics.com/shortcuts "ShortCuts on Go Comics") by Jeff Harris.
Diving into the adventure that is The Catholic Faith, Joe and his friends
find themselves right in the middle of fun aspects of Catholic life.
<br><br>

Subjects include Church history, sacramental theology, the Bible, the moral life, and liturgy.
<br><br>

Whevener possible, original sources like the Scriptures, The Catechism of the Catholic Church,
the Code of Canon Law, writings of the Saints, and Magisterial documents are used,
so that sound teaching may be communicated through this medium.
